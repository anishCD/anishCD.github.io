# Let me introduce myself.

Iâ€™m an engineer &amp; researcher actively seeking opportunites for software engineering roles in the fields of machine learning, software engineering, and financial technology, among others!


I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego with an expected graduation of December 2024.

Feel free to explore my [projects](#projects) to see some of my recent work, or take a look at my [CV](/cv.pdf) for a more detailed overview of my experience and skills.

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and interesting conversations. Whether you're interested in my work, have a project in mind, or just want to chat, I'd love to hear from you.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
